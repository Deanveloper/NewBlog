So I made a blog! I have a few posts planned already, can't wait to start making them!
Here are a couple of spoilers for y'all, no specified order.

* Properties vs Fields
* A post explaining how nice of a programming language [Kotlin][kotlin] is
* Creating a post-maker for Jekyll (the engine behind this blog)
* Many more to come!

Feel free to leave feedback by either emailing me or using the Disqus comments!
